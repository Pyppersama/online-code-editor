# online-code-editor

Project Summary:

The Online Code Editor is a web application that allows users to write and run HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code directly in their browser. It provides a user-friendly interface with separate code editor sections for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with a result container to view the output. The application includes tab navigation for easy switching between code editor sections and a "Run" button to execute the code and display the result.

Technologies Used:

HTML: Used for structuring the web page and defining the elements.

CSS: Applied for styling the user interface, including the navigation, code editor containers, and result container.

JavaScript: Implemented to add interactivity to the application, such as toggling code editor containers, running the code, and dynamically updating the iframe content.

jQuery: Utilized as a JavaScript library to simplify DOM manipulation and event handling.

The project showcases proficiency in front-end web development, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the jQuery library. It demonstrates the ability to create interactive web applications and work with code editors. The Online Code Editor can be a valuable tool for developers to quickly test and experiment with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code snippets without the need for a dedicated code editor or IDE.
